This is a tool for trying to determine the date that a text was written based on the ngrams contained in it.

#####Usage:
To use the demo, call analyzer.py with a filepath as the only argument.
To use it as a library, just import learn.py
Requirements: Python 2.7, Numpy, Requests, NLTK (I recommend using the Anaconda Python distribution)


#####TODO:
- Improve command line interface
- Improve caching performance
- Explore other data sources
- Add new ways of making buckets
